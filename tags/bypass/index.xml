&lt;/div>DNS tunneling The idea of this technique is to use the DNS protocol to route all the traffic, just like a VPN! Of course this method will make your connection slower but will allow you to bypass certain systems like network filters or captive portals. Obviously, you could use this to exfiltrate data too.
The reason why this works is that normally when captive portals or firewalls rules are setup, the administrators block all TCP and UDP connections when certain rule is met but they forget about checking DNS queries.</description></item></channel></rss>
