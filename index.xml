            </div>Attacking Wi-Fi networks with Aircrack-ng Introduction Before starting, remember that Wi-Fi uses management frames (datagrams are called frames in this context) and data frames. Only data frames are encrypted.

Right now, I use a Raspberry Pi 4 B as a little server to run Pi Hole, personal projects, Plex&hellip; and also as a NAS. All this sevices are run using Docker containers because I love Docker and the management is easier that way, allowing me to recover from a failure really quick.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
