Introduction You may be thinking: &ldquo;I just buy the Wi-Fi Flipper board and call it a day&rdquo; well, not really. Even buying the Flipper Wi-Fi Devboard instead of making a custom module won&rsquo;t enable the Flipper to start de-authenticating people out of the box, you will need to flash the proper firmware.]]></description></item><item><title>MAGI Project a year later</title><link>https://blog.anthares101.com/magi-project-a-year-later/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Anthares101</author><guid>https://blog.anthares101.com/magi-project-a-year-later/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>MAGI Project a year later How has MAGI behaved in the last year? Is the Kubernetes cluster even alive? Well, the header image is kind of spoiling the answers to those questions but, since the idea of the post is talking a bit about the implication of having an on premise Kubernetes cluster, you may be interested in continue reading.
Is MAGI still running? You probably already knew the answer but yes!</description></item><item><title>DNS tunneling</title><link>https://blog.anthares101.com/dns-tunneling/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Anthares101</author><guid>https://blog.anthares101.com/dns-tunneling/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>DNS tunneling The idea of this technique is to use the DNS protocol to route all the traffic, just like a VPN! Of course this method will make your connection slower but will allow you to bypass certain systems like network filters or captive portals. Obviously, you could use this to exfiltrate data too.
The reason why this works is that normally when captive portals or firewalls rules are setup, the administrators block all TCP and UDP connections when certain rule is met but they forget about checking DNS queries.</description></item><item><title>Attacking Wi-Fi networks with Aircrack-ng</title><link>https://blog.anthares101.com/attacking-wi-fi-networks-with-aircrack-ng/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Anthares101</author><guid>https://blog.anthares101.com/attacking-wi-fi-networks-with-aircrack-ng/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

Introduction Wi-Fi uses management frames (datagrams are called frames in this context) and data frames. Only data frames are encrypted and injecting them into the network will require a previous association with the AP. This is not necessary for management frames or if we send data frames spoofing some of the clients MAC addresses.</description></item><item><title>MAGI Project</title><link>https://blog.anthares101.com/magi-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Anthares101</author><guid>https://blog.anthares101.com/magi-project/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>MAGI project The idea I have been thinking about the idea of building a cluster made of Raspberrys and update my home infrastructure a bit. Right now, I use a Raspberry Pi 4 B as a little server to run Pi Hole, personal projects, Plex&hellip; and also as a NAS. All this sevices are run using Docker containers because I love Docker and the management is easier that way, allowing me to recover from a failure really quick.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
