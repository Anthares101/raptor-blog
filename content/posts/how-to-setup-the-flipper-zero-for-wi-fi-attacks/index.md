# How to setup the Flipper Zero for Wi-Fi attacks

Before starting, remember that performing any of the attacks explained in this post to networks without previous consent is illegal, this post information is for educational purposes only.

## Introduction

You may be thinking: "I just buy the Wi-Fi Flipper board and call it a day" well, not really. Even buying the Flipper Wi-Fi Devboard instead of making a custom module won't enable the Flipper to start de-authenticating people out of the box, you will need to flash the proper firmware.

This post will focus on the Flipper Wi-Fi Devboard but, in theory, the process described should work with anything based on the ESP32-S2 module.

## Requisites

- Obviously a Flipper Zero.
- A Flipper WiFi Devboard or anything based on the ESP32-S2 module that can be connected to the Flipper.
- Any device that can be use to transfer necessary files to the Flipper.

## Go time!

### Preparing necessary files

TODO: Explain firmwares and the double installation.

### Flashing
