            </div>Attacking Wi-Fi networks with Aircrack-ng Introduction Before starting, remember that Wi-Fi uses management frames (datagrams are called frames in this context) and data frames. Only data frames are encrypted.
Also, injecting data frames will require a previous association with the AP but this is not necessary for management frames.
About the hardware you will need, make sure your wireless card support monitor mode. Normally you would need a USB external adapter because internal cards won&rsquo;t allow you to use them in monitor mode but maybe you are lucky!]]></description></item></channel></rss>
